# PIXEL MANIPULATION FOR IMAGE ENCRYPTION
#Introduction to Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption Using Python
Pixel manipulation for image encryption is a technique where the pixel values of an image are altered to transform the image into an encrypted form. This encrypted image should look significantly different from the original, making it difficult to interpret without the decryption key. The primary goal is to protect the image from unauthorized access by making the content unreadable without decryption.

#Basic Concept
In digital images, each pixel's color is represented by values of red, green, and blue (RGB). By modifying these pixel values based on a certain key, we can encrypt the image. The same key can be used in reverse to decrypt the image, restoring it to its original form.
